Sitevision has a feature which lets you view the rendering times of all the modules on the page. This feature is toggled by the query parameter `profiling` with the values `true` or `false`. The state is stored in your session, so you'll have to turn it off by yourself.

This bookmarklet toggles the query parameter for you.
