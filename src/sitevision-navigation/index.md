This bookmarklet will let you navigate to the direct children of the current page on a website built with Sitevision. Useful when there is no menu or when the pages are hidden. When there are no direct sub pages (type `sv:page`) but at least one folder (type `sv:folder`), the folder's sub pages will be listed instead.
